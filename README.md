# nn_memory

Perceptron with a hypothesized Memory Unit with an implementation that is able to increase the convergence rate of the perceptron.

Graphs plotted for normal convergence and Memory Unit convergence show that the Perceptron-Memory Unit pair converges a lot faster for the same dataset. The convergence curve and rate can further be controlled by tweaking the Memory Unit parameters.
